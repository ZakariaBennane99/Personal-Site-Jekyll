### A Little More

Hey! I was born in [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca) city during the dot com bubble. I worked in a variety of jobs, from sewing beds at Souk “Al Qurayaa” in my native city at 9 to varnishing wood at my uncle’s workshop. Currently, I’m studying for a BBA, sharing my toughts, and making things.

I recently discovered that I’m an HSP -- **Highly Sensitive Person**. The more I read and learn, the more I became aware of myself. I’m already an Assertive Defender (you can read about it [here](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/39fcc76411111)), and I know I have an unsatiable appetite for new experiences and challenges. Now, I’m trying to further discover myself by connecting with other people, offering value through my projects, and taking up some crazy challenges.
