### Proderto
After a year long learning all I could about web developement, I decided to build something from scrtach, and the results was Proderto - a goal sharing platform for the Internet.

### SumBroo
Tried building a plugin that used GPT-4 to summarize LinkedIn video courses. However, I couldn't monetize it. So, I used its design for SumBroo, an idea I had last summer. The concept? Applying the idea of blog posting to social media, but on a larger scale.
